Benchmark shows time of excecution for different getRange function implementations.
Parallel version with parameter n, cuts range for ~n parts and uses getRange n times.
You can set benchmark test cases in "test/settings.js" in array getRangeTests.
For each test case benchmark outputs time of execution, test case message and found value.
All test cases runs in parallel.

test case sample:

    {
        adr: "6badc9463c5cc91cbfb5176ef99a454c3c77b00e",
        idx: stateDB.atStruct(0, 1),
        startBlock: 1110000,
        endBlock: 1113334,
        cb: testLog,
        expectedOutput: '', // unnecessary field
        msg: 'at struct(0,1) search in 3334 blocks'
    },

implementation versions:

  EthStorage - most up to date code version (current implementation like "Transactions")
  HashSet - uses hashset to remember visited hashes
  LastPath - remembers last visited path in array
  None - checks change in block with no hash checking
  Set - uses set to remember visited hashes
  SingleQueries - requests value from each block independently
  Transactions - reads transaction list to find blocks with change, also uses hashset
  Web3 - requests value from each block independently, using Web3 interface delivered on localhost:8545
